We are Motify Games, our goal is to create quality non-predatory games for our players to enjoy and remember. 

Our name comes from the word motif and its meaning on literature and music, a piece that often is what you remember most from a whole. To us it means we want to add motif to our games and for our games to work as motif for our players, you could say we're motifying our games.
