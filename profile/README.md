We are Motify Games, our goal is to create quality non-predatory games for our players to enjoy and remember. 

Our name comes from the work motif and it's meaning on literature and music, as piece that often is what you remember the most from the whole. So we want to add motif to our games and for out games to work as motif for our players, you could say we're motifying our games.
